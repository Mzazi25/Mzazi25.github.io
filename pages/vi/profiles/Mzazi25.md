## About Me
I am a Passionate Software Developer with a focus of **Native Android applications**.
My strongest skills include: Debugging, Refactoring, Researching and Learning New and Upcoming Technologies.:smiley:

I also love Open Source Technologies and I am a believer that intellectual growth is indispensable and it never exhausts the mind.

In my free time, I love working out in the gym:muscle: but I dont like ~~running~~ :running::laughing:
